# Tip Calculator Project

Hey ðŸ‘‹  

This is just a little practice project I built to learn some JavaScript basics.  
It takes the meal price, adds a tip %, and shows you the total.  

## How it works
- You type in how much the meal cost.  
- You type in the tip % (default is 12.5).  
- Hit "Calculate" â†’ it adds the tip and gives you the total bill.  
- Rounds to 2 decimal places so it looks like real money.  

## Tech stuff
- HTML for the page  
- CSS for a bit of style  
- JavaScript for the math  

Run it by opening `index.html` in a browser, or click **Go Live** in VS Code.

Itâ€™s simple, but it does the job. Good starter piece for practicing GitHub + VS Code + Live Server.
